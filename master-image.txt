	#hdmi_edid_file=1

#Added the pregenerated edid.dat file from the westinghouse 32" tv to app etc
	@/opt/contestnet/etc/edid-westinghouse-32.dat

#Created the contestnet.conf file and populated it with the default id of 0

	exit
	
#Set all members of sudo group to be able to sudo without password

#Copied loopable version of omxplayer to /opt/omxplayer (tarball must be unzipped on the machine or it won't work)

#Added latest version of launcher and worker

#Restored master card from contestnet-master-003.img after filling it up while applying updates

#Created root cronttab and added entry for wireless-monitor to run every 5 minutes and forces the wireless adapter up if it does not have an address
# */5 * * * * /opt/wireless-monitor/bin/wireless-monitor

#Disabled the crontab entry so it does not happen in the base image. this will need to be added to the customization checklist for generating new disks.

!! Need to get the edid file for the panasonics included in the base image
!! Need to install the cec utility

#Applied additional updates
	sudo apt-get update
	sudo apt-get upgrade

#Installed the cec-util package to allow for control of connected units through CEC.

#	I should probably update the way that the terminal software interacts with the display to make it modular
